# DUIT-Task 
- Develop a video player app and shows ad on every 10th seconds of the video for about 5 seconds.
- I developed the app that plays the video and shows ad for 5 seconds on 10th second of the video. I have developed the library for showing an image as ad for 5 seconds. 
- For creating the library, I made the new project and performed the required work, after that I changed it from application to Library and build the .jar file. 
- After creating the .jar file I used it as library in the main Video player project to show the ads.
